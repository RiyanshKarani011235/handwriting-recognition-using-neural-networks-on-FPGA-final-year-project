--> comparision between python and C for execution time for convolution operation

1)'''horizontal edge detection, vertical edge detection and gaussian filtering'''
2)horizontal and vertical from both directions in just one nested for loop
3)advanced high speed convolution in C (and real time edge detection if possible)
3)connedted object segmentation
5)compressing or expanding an image to a predetermined size (or some alternative)
4)design neural network for image sizes obtained from segmentation and sizing
5)neural network training and classification
